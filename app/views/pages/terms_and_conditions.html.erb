      Fees and Payment
      <ol class="level-1">
        <li>Fees payable in advance. The use of certain Services will be subject to payment of Fees.  Shopmatic will provide notice of such Fees then in effect on the Platform. If you wish to receive or use such Services, you are required to pay all applicable Fees in advance.</li>

We will charge applicable Fees to the Authorised Card and we will continue to charge the Authorised Card (or any replacement card) for applicable Fees until the Services are terminated and/or any and all outstanding Fees have been paid in full.

In order to ensure that you do not experience any interruption or loss of Services, your subscription will be automatically renewed on a recurring fees basis (except where explicitly stated otherwise by Shopmatic in writing).  Accordingly, where applicable, Shopmatic will attempt to automatically renew the Services for a renewal period equal in time to the original subscription period for such Services, and automatically charge you the applicable Fees using the Authorised Card on the subscription renewal date.  For example, if the original subscription plan you have for the Services is six (6) months, each of its renewal period will be for six (6) months.  We will notify you by email at least seven (7) days prior to the expiry of the then current subscription period to remind you of the upcoming renewal.  Therefore, unless you cancel your Account within seven (7) days prior to the subscription renewal date, we will automatically renew such Service when it comes up for renewal and charge you the applicable recurring Fees. In the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by you, we may in sole discretion to retry to collect on a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your Account, without further notice.</li>
        <li>Invoices.  Shopmatic and its affiliated companies will issue an invoice to you for the payment of Fees (“Invoice”).  Each Invoice will be issued in electronic form and be made available to you by email within seven (7) days after the subscription renewal date</li>

        <li>Refunds. We do not provide refunds, pro-rata or otherwise.</li>
        <li>Chargebacks. If, at any time, you contact your bank or credit/debit card company and chargeback or otherwise reject the charge of any payable Fees (“Chargeback”), this act will be considered a breach of your payment obligations under the Terms of Service and your use of the Services may be automatically terminated by us.  In the event that a Chargeback occurs, your Account may be blocked without the option to re-use it and any User Content and End User data, including any domains and Third Party Services may be subject to cancellation. Your use of the Services will not resume until you have paid all applicable Fees in full, including any fees and expenses incurred by us and/or Third Party Services for each Chargeback received. We reserve the right to dispute any Chargeback received, including by providing the relevant card company with any information and documentation proving that you did in fact authorise the transaction and make use of the Services.</li>
